You appear to be trapped in some sort of pocket in space time.
An ominous entity promises you safe passage to any place you desire for taking part in their experiments.
If you fail them, you appear to travel back in time and have to repeat the same experiments all over again


# How to play:
Use WASD / arrow keys and space bar to move and your mouse to look around.
Collect flags and bring spheres to their receptacles for additional time.

# About this game:
My first 3D game using Unity.
